# Java-2D-Array--Random-number-print-in-Array-form


Welcome to the Java 2D Array Random Print repository! This project provides an in-depth exploration of array and 2D array manipulation, coupled with the usage of random numbers in Java.

## Description

This Java project offers a comprehensive demonstration of working with arrays and 2D arrays. It fills and prints a 4x5 array using nested for-loops, generating random integers between 0 and 9 for each element. Additionally, it presents an alternative method that employs enhanced for-loops to print random numbers directly without populating the array. By exploring these different approaches, this project provides valuable insights into efficient array handling in Java.

## Usage

To explore this project:

1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
4. Compile the Java files using the command:
5. Run the compiled program using the command:
6. Observe the output printed to the console, showcasing the manipulation of arrays and 2D arrays along with random number generation.
